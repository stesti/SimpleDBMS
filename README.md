# SimpleDBMS
SimpleDBMS is a software implementation of a simple distributed database
using 2-phase-commit for the spreading of updates I wrote in 2008 for a
small university project.
It is quite basic and simple but might be helpful to give insights on
2 phase commit protocol.
Please refer to attached PDF "Report.pdf" for detailed explanation with
graphs.
